I had to make a fresh start because I started to use Git Gui. After pushing with "Force Overwrite Existing Branch" option, I started again with the first commit.

## Project Definition

### Name of the project: BMI Calculator

Body Mass Index (BMI) is simply a guideline to track weight issues. It is a measurement of body fat based on weight. BMI calculation for females and males would differ. BMI is the amount of fat content in the body as related to height and weight. This is a way of measuring the fat content and muscle mass so that the person knows whether they are healthy or whether they can be prone to health problems like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, or even certain types of cancer.

## Installing



## Version

BMI Calculator v0.11

## Known bugs



## Development Stages

Ongoing developemnts and completed developments are briefly described in 'Project Development Stages' issue.


## Sources and Libraries and Tools

[Eclipse Neon IDE](http://www.eclipse.org) will be used developing software with using framewoks.

[Java](https://www.java.com) will be used to write the codes.

[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) will be used for using Java Spring.

Java based [Spring Framework](http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/) will be used to develop project with security.
Spring Tool Suite - The Eclipse-based development environment for building Spring applications. will be used.

[JQuery](http://jquery.com) used for writing smaller and better scripts and effects.

[JQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com) used for providing cool buttons and effects.

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download) is used to provide much cool buttons, and solves scalability issue for most devices.

[MYSQL](http://www.mysql.com) will be used as a database. MYSQL should be sufficient for that small scale project.


## Used Technologies

After researching some weeks, thanks to [roseindia](http://www.roseindia.net/spring/) ,I learned Java Spring basics and started to write Java Spring codes. JSP is the default for front-end. However, I don't want to consume my time with struggling JSP requests and responses. I will try to integrate HTML instead of JSP into my Spring project.
More technologies will be used connect the USDA database and insert gifs into the HTML pages later.


## Project Design

Mockups will give a representation of the productâ€™s visual appearance. Mockups will focus mainly on the visual look of the product, but also hint at the basics of its functionality. These mockups will be shown to the stakeholder for early feedback. Mockups are created with the help of GIMP and paint.

## Time Tracking

Time tracking is done via RescueTime system. RescueTime tracks my performance and it really improves and gives me interesting results. It has a desktop app, and a browser add on. It tracks every process which user opens. Browser add on tracks the browser and it shows how much time do you work or waste. Moreover, if you use notepad++ or any other software to develop codes, RescueTime will understand and show how much time do you work. For example: [Rescuetime 1](https://github.com/sanal-cem/Fall2016Swe573_Cem_Sanal/tree/master/DOC/RescueTime%20Doc/activities.png),

[Rescuetime 2](https://github.com/sanal-cem/Fall2016Swe573_Cem_Sanal/tree/master/DOC/RescueTime%20Doc/yearly.png)

After tracking myself with RescueTime, I enter the results into an [excel sheet](https://github.com/sanal-cem/Fall2016Swe573_Cem_Sanal/tree/master/DOC/Gantt_Chart_BMI.xlsx).
